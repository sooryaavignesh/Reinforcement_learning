# Reinforcement Learning
Deployed a deep learning model to learn control patterns from visual inputs and applied it to the Flappy birds game. Designed a deep convolutional neural network to recognize the current state of the game and parse that information to evaluate the Q-function of reinforcement learning and achieved super-human performance.
